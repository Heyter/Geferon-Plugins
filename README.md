# Geferon's Plugins

This is a repository of Misc plugins that I will be developing on the go.
I will both try to release plugins frequently and try to take requests if there are some.

You can contribute to this Github repo by adding translations, pointing issues with the plugins, adding other languages translations or giving me ideas for new plugins. Either complex or very easy to do.

## Currently, this repo has the following plugins:

- improved_areas

   This plugin adds new types of Areas which you can configure with a weapon. Right now there is just one type of Area, which is Scrolling.
   I'll be updating this plugin in the go.
   Uses [Luabee Zones System](https://github.com/Luabee/Zones)


- scoreboard_replacement

   What this plugin does is quite simple. It adds two options in game which are: sbShowF1Menu and sbOnMainMenu
   What sbShowF1Menu does when set to true is disable the default scoreboard and opens the default F1 menu when pressing Tab (Default button assigned to open the scoreboard)
   As if this wasn't enough, the option sbOnMainMenu adds quite a few other options, as it allows the scoreboard to be shown on the F1 menu

   Also, this plugin adds as well some extra options to the scoreboard menu when pressing a players icon, as "Add to Whitelist" and "Remove from Whitelist", as well as some others.


- tying_improvements

   This plugin enables searching a player when tied and tying a player if you've got Zip Ties in your inventory with the F2 button.


- observer_plus

   This plugin adds new features to the default observer, showing the players health, armor and current weapon, and if the current weapon is lowered or not (the text is red when its equipped and white when its lowered)
